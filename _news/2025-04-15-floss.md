Our paper [FLOSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10487) is out with [code](https://github.com/yasserben/FLOSS). It builds on the intruiging observations that some CLIP templates excel at given semantic segmentation classes. FLOSS formulates a new training-free Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation that can be plugged into any methods. Bravo [Yasser](https://yasserben.github.io/) and team.
