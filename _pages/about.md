description: <strong>We study 2D vision and 3D perception for robust scene understanding.</strong> Our research focuses on relaxing the use of abundant data and supervision, stepping towards weak-/un-supervised vision algorithms, while providing models that are more interpretable. We primarily address autonomous driving but our research expands to a variety of indoor and outdoor applications.
